Case Study- Introduction:
This case study focuses on a small yoga studio that offers sessions six days a week, charging a flat rate of $15
per session. The goal is to improve the studio&#39;s return on investment (ROI) by identifying high-profit sessions
and proposing alternatives for low-ROI sessions.

Key Insights
1. High ROI Sessions
 Saturday noon records highest ROI of 225%
 Saturday Morning records second highest ROI 200%
2. Low ROI Sessions
Saturday Evening records Lowest ROI at -33%.
Profitability Analysis
Morning and Noon Sessions Generally show higher profitability due to higher attendance and
revenue. These sessions consistently generate significant profits, with Saturday Noon being the most
profitable.
Afternoon and Evening Sessions: Some afternoon sessions, particularly on weekdays and Saturday
evenings, are unprofitable. These sessions have lower attendance and revenue, leading to negative
ROI.
Now let’s talk about the ROOT Cause for LOW ROI Sessions
1. Low attendance

2. Inconvenient Time slots
3. Competition with other activities
4. Session Quality
5. Lack of awareness
Detailed analysis of Root causes
 Morning and Noon Sessions: High attendance indicates that participants prefer these times, possibly
due to better alignment with their daily routines.
 Afternoon and Evening Sessions: Lower attendance suggests a misalignment with participant
schedules and preferences. Afternoon Sessions may also conflict with work hours, school schedules,
or other mid-day commitments, leading to lower attendance whereas Evening sessions are generally
more convenient but they should make note of specific evenings (e.g., Saturday) that may conflict
with the customers social plans.
 Instructor Influence: The popularity of sessions can heavily depend on the instructor&#39;s reputation,
teaching style, and ability to engage participants. Less popular instructors may lead to lower
attendance and ROI.
 Insufficient Promotion: Low-ROI sessions may not be effectively marketed. Participants may be
unaware of these sessions or their unique benefits.
 Participant Feedback: Lack of regular feedback mechanisms might prevent the studio from
addressing participant needs and preferences effectively.
 Performance marketing: The Studio should get involved more in performance marketing in order to
reach more people and create brand awareness and brand value.
Recommendations to address LOW ROI
1. Adjust Scheduling:
 Revaluate Timing: Consider rescheduling or reducing the number of low-attendance
afternoon and evening sessions. Experiment with different time slots based on participant
feedback.
2. Enhance Marketing Efforts:
 Targeted Promotions: Develop marketing campaigns specifically for low-ROI sessions.
Highlight unique aspects or benefits to attract more participants. Offer discounts, loyalty
programs, or referral bonuses for these sessions to boost attendance.

3. Improve Session Experience:
 Instructor Training: Invest in training to ensure all instructors can deliver high-quality,
engaging sessions.
 Variety of sessions: Introduce new types of yoga or themed sessions to make less popular
time slots more attractive.
4. Gather Participant Feedback:
 Surveys and Feedback Forms: Regularly collect feedback to understand participant
preferences and improve session offerings. Conduct focus groups to gain deeper insights into
why certain sessions are less popular and how to improve them.

5. Optimize Costs:

 Cost Management: Explore ways to reduce fixed and variable costs for low-attendance
sessions without compromising quality. Each session as a fixed cost of $116 regardless of
attendance. Low attendance directly impacts profitability as these costs are not offset by
participant fees.
 Dynamic Pricing: Consider a variable pricing model where less popular sessions are priced
lower to attract more participants. Managing teacher and other session-related costs is
crucial, especially for sessions with lower attendance.
Conclusions
These insights and recommendations will help the yoga studio optimize its schedule, manage costs,
and improve overall profitability. Regularly updating and analysing data will ensure continuous
improvement and adaptation to participant preferences and market conditions.
